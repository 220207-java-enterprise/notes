Exceptions
->	Difference between checked vs unchecked exceptions vs compilation error
	-> Exceptions occur after application runs
		-> Checked exceptions are checked by the compiler. Code will not compile. We must handle (try/catch or throws) before we run the application
		-> Unchecked exceptions are not checked by the compiler. Code will run even if you dont handle it. (RuntimeException)
	-> compilation errors fail during compilaltion (syntax error)

	How to create custom exceptions?
	-> create own class for exception and extend from an Exception class

.equals() and ==
-> 	== checks for equality
	.equals() checks for location in heap memory
	.equals() needs to be @Override so we can modify the inherited method
	
Encapsulation
->	Access Modifiers (default, protected, private, public)
	Getters/Setters
