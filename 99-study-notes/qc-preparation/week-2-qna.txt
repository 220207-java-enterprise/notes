# Unit Testing (by abhilekh)

- What is Unit Testing and why do we do it?

		aka Method Testing
		We unit test to validate the smallest component of our application
		Methods are tested in isolation

-	Test file and Class file (SystemUnderTest sut)
	
		Package structure for both files are mirrored
		THerefore service class variables are available on the test context
		
		This is how the TestClassSuite communicates with the SystemUnderTest
		
		TestClassSuite contains all methods we create to test the SUT.
		SystemUnderTest is the class whose methods TCS is testing


-	AAA structure in unit testing
		
		Each Unit Test method must follow the Arrange, Act, Assert structure

-	Java Reflection
		
		java.lang.reflection package
		
		A feature in Java programming language

		allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself,
		
		in order to manipulate internal properties		

		example - a Java class can obtain names of all it's members and display them

-	Annotations in a Test file
	
		@Documented 						- will show up in generated Docs when used
		@Target(ElementType=?) 			- indicates where we can use this annotation
		@Retention(RetentionPolicy=?)	- indicates at what point the annotation should be discarded
												RUNTIME/CLASS/SOURCE

- Writing an Annotation
		
		public @interface Test{
			String description() default ""; // declares a field that can be added as arguments
		}											// default "" makes argument optional



## Docker
- What is a virtual machine?
		
		A virtual machine is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer.

- What is a container?
	
		A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies.
		
- What is the difference between a virtual machine and a container?

		Virtual Machines are Guest Operating Systems
		Cross communicaiton betwen VMs is not easy.

		Contianers are slimmed down
		Operated by Container Engines that run on Host OS
		
		A lot of memory is saved by using Containers over VMs
		

- What does the command "docker ps" do?

		lists docker containers that are running. PS = Process Status

- What Docker CLI command can be used to access a running container's file system?

		docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash

- How do you run a container?

		"Works on my machine" problem
		Not all computers have the same environment congifurations
		containers ensure that our application is portable for different machine environments

- Why do we use Docker?
		
		An application cannot be guaranteed to run uniformly
		A lot depends on the environmental variables of a machine
		Docker is a cool tool that helps us "containerize" our applications
		Encapsulates application logic with a pre-defined environment
		We use docker to mitigate this 		


## Relational Databases
- What is a relational database used for?

		Organizes data into tables which can be linked based on data common to each other
		This allows us to create interesting reports for the data stored in them

- What is the relationship between PostgreSQL and DBeaver? What does what?
		
		PostgreSQL is a RDBMS
		RDBMS is a software that allows CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE functionality

		DBeaver is a database tool that supports all databases including PostgreSQL
				

- What is meant by the word "schema" when discussing relational databases?

		Schemas is the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed
		Includes all tables and their relationships
		Also helps separate databases as separate "workspaces" in DBeaver

- What structure is used to store data in a relational database?

		A relational database stores data in tables.
		Tables are organized into columns and each colum stores one type of data.
		Rows are single instances of the table
		
- What is a primary key?

		The column that contain values that uniqely idenntify each row in a table				

- Can a table have more that one primary key?

		No

- What is a candidate key?

		Another column that contain values that uniquely identify each row
		Possible "Candidates" for Primary Key

- What are some common data constraints we may put onto table columns?

		NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY etc...
		
- What are some common data types we may specify for table columns?

		VARCHAR, BOOLEAN, NUMBER, BLOB, TEXT etc...	
	
- How can we create "relationships" between two different tables within our database?
	
		Relationships are made by creating a Foreign Key Constraint.
		One table contains a foreign key that identifies the PK of another table.
		
- What is meant by multiplicity when discussing relational data models?

		Multiplicity is an attribute between two tables that specifies the cardinality
		Cardinality means the number of instances of one entity can be associated with another
		0:1, 1:1, 1:M
		
- What should happen when data from one table is deleted but is referenced by a record in another table? What is concept this called?
		
		We must retain flexibility of the database by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent data
		This is called Normalization
		

- What is a Lookup table?

		A table that acts as a "master list" for something

- What is a Junction Table

		A table that enables to create a many to many relation between two tables

- Drop vs Truncate Table
		
		DROP deletes a table
		TRUNCATE deletes all rows from a table

- DDL, DML, DCL, TCL

		DDL - Data Definition Language			CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, TRUNCATE
		DML - Data Manipulation Language			SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
		DCL - Data Control Language				GRANT, REVOKE
		TCL - Transaction Control Language		START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK

- Transaction Properties

		ACID Properties

		Atomicity		-The entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all
		Consistency	-The database must be consistent before and after the transaction
		Isolation		-Multiple Transactions occur independently withour interference
		Durability	-The changes of a successful transaction occurs even if system failure occurs

- Commit in SQL Server

		Commit is used for permanent changes.
		Using Commit, change made by that query will be permanent and visible.
		We can't Rollback after the Commit.

- Rollback in SQL Server

		ROLLBACK is a command that causes data changes
		since the last BEGIN WORK , or START TRANSACTION to be discarded by the RDBMS
		So that the state of the data is "rolled back" to the way it was before those changes were made.

- Setting Savepoints

		SQL Server savepoints are used to roll back transactions to a specified point.


- Scalar functions

		Functions which return a single value from an input value


- Aggregate Functions

		Functions that performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value

- Set Operations

		The four set operators union, union all, intersect and except
		Allow us to serially combine two or more select statements

- Nested Query
		
		Subquery or Inner query
		Query within another SQL query
		embedded within the WHERE clause

		example:
			SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
			FROM   table1 [, table2 ]
			WHERE  column_name OPERATOR
   			(SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
   			FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   			[WHERE])

- Indexes
		
		Indexes are special lookup tables 
		The database search engine can use it to speed up data retrieval
		An index is a pointer to data in a table
		
- Views
		
		A virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement

## DataStructure and Algorithm

- Arrays

		Linear data structure
		Elements can be added in a continuous manner in memory address space
										
- ArrayList
		
		Class belonging to the Collection framework
		We can pass type of element we can store in ArrayList
		Size grows dynamically
		
		eg:		ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<Integer>;
