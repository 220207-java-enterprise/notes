Java Basics
	Building Blocks of Programming
		Values and Variables
		Operations
		Expressions and Statements
		Decisions
		Loops
		Function/Methods

	Java Variables
		A name representing some value stored in computer memory
		Variables in Java are labeled as a specific type (either primitive or objects)
			String username = "jsmith";
			int age = 23;
		Variable naming rules
			Reserved keywords cannot be uses
			Cannot start with a digit but digits can be used (eg: name1 is valid)
			Can start with a letter, an underscore or a dollar sign
			Cannot use other symbols or spaces (%,^,&)
			Best practice: give variables meaningful names

	Java Primitive Datatypes and their Wrapper classes
		boolean - Boolean
		byte - Byte
		char - Character
		double - Double
		float - Float
		int - Integer
		long - Long
		short - Short

	Java Expressions and Statements
		An expression is akin to a clause in the English language which portrays a specific meaning.
			It can stand alone or be a part of a sentance
		A statement is one or more expressions that forms a complete unit of execution
			In Java, all statements end with a semicolon (;)

	Java Flow Control
		Decision-making statements
			if-else statements
			switch statements
		Iterative statements
			for loops
			while loops
			do-while loops
		Branching statements
			break statements
			continue statements

	IF statements
		Consists of a condition, followed by a statement or a set of statements
		Statements are executed only when the given condition is true
			If the condition is false then the statements inside the if statement body are completely ignored

	IF-ELSE statements
		The statements inside of the if block will execute if the condition is true, and the statements inside the else block would execute if the condition is false

	IF-ELSE-IF statements
		Used when we need to check multiple conditions
		As soon as a condition is met, the corresponding set of statements get executed, rest gets ignored
			If none of the condition is met then the statements inside "else" gets executed (if present)

	Nested IF statements
		The code within the outer if statement will execute if its condiditon is true.
		THe code inside of the nested if statement will only execute if both the conditions the outer condition and its own condition are true

	Switch Statements
		Use the switch keyword followed by a set of parenthesis used to pass a value into the switch block
		The value passed into the switch block is compared to nested code blocks called 'cases'
		Each case has a value associated to it that is compared to the value passed into the switch statement to determine if that case's code block should be executed
		There can be an optional default block that will be executed in case none of the case conditions are met
