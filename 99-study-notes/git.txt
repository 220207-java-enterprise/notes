Git
	Software Configuration Management
		SCM is the task of tracking and controlling changes for an application or suite of applications
	Primary Objectives
		Identifies all items that collectively define the software configuration
		Manages changes to one or more of these items
		Facilitates the construction of different versions of an application
	What is being tracked?
		Source code files, Data schema files, Build specification files, Container images, Documentation files
	Git- A version control system
		Distributed version control system
		Industry standard
		Secure
		Flexible
	Git Repositories
		A Git repository is simply a data source containing all the information needed to retain and manage the revisions and history of a project
		Within a repository, Git maintains two primary data structures, the object store and the index.
		All of this repository data is stored at the root of your working directory in a hidden subdirectory named .git
	Object Store
		Contains data files, log messages, author information, dates and other information required to rebuild any version or branch of the project
		Fundamental Objects - Blobs, Trees, Commits, Tags
	Index
		A temporary and dynamic binary file that describes the directory structure of the entire repository
		Captures a version of the project's overall structure at some point in time
			Depending on what branch and commit we have checked out
	Can be manipulated in methodical, well-defined steps
		Add, manipulate or delete some file which is managed within a Git repository
		Stage file changes
		Commit staged changes to the index
	Pack File
		Git compresses and stores the objects in pack files, which are placed in the object store
		Git first locates files whose content is very similar and stores the complete content for one of them.
		It then computes the differences, or deltas, between similar files and stores just the differences.
	Branches
		A Git branch is essentially an independent line of development
		Can be taken advantage of branching when working on new features or bug fixes because it isolates your work from that of other team members
	Git repository Hosting Websites
		GitHub, GitLab, AWS CodeCommit, Bitbucket, SourceForge
	Best Practices
		Commit Regularly
		Provide detailed commit message
		Levarage a branching strategy
		Communicate with the team
