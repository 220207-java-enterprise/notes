Docker

- Why do we even need it?

	"Works on my machine problem" is a very common problem in SD
	reason why we face this problem is because developers may have the same exact codebase or the logic
	everything goes well when the environment is configured uniformly
	but if any user who is using the application is missing even one dependency, this is a cause for concern
	we want to ensure that our applicaiton is portable for different machine environments

	Because an application runs on an environment, different environments produce different effects

	Environment variables are out of the control of JVM

- How does Docker mitigate this?
	
	Docker is a cool tool that helps us "containerize" our applications
	Docker encapsulates the application logic as well as pre-define environment that is crucial in running the application

- How is Docker different than VMs?
	
							VM vs Container visual

			Virtual Machines							Containers
		________________________________				________________________________
		App1		App2		App3					App1		App2		App3
		________________________________				________________________________
		Bins/Lib	Bins/Lib	Bins/Lib				Bins/Lib	Bins/Lib	Bins/Lib
		________________________________				________________________________				
		GuestOS	GuestOS	GuestOS					Container Engine
		________________________________				________________________________
			Hypervisor								Operating System							
		________________________________				________________________________
			Infrastructure							Infrastructure
		________________________________				________________________________


		
		Virtual Machines are Guest Operating Systems cross communication between them is not efficient

		Containers are slimmed down and is operated by Container Engines that run on the Host Operating System
		Container engines will only include exactly what they need to run Applications.
		A lot of memory is saved by using Containers over VMs.

		Therefore, Containers are light-weight.


What is a Docker Image?
	
	Images are snapshots of applications that helps us recreate containers on demand.
	I have used DockerHub to download an image for PostgresSQL and used it on my projects at Revature.
