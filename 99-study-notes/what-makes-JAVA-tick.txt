What Makes Java Tick?
	The Java Platform
		A platform is the environment in which a piece of software is executed
			Could refer to hardware and an OS, but could also refer to a software-only environment
		Made available to consumers in the form of the JRE, which is used to execute java applications
		Made available to consumers in the form of the JDK, which is used to develop java applications
		Java's flexibility to "write once, run anywhere" is facilitated by the JVM, which ensures platform-interdependence
	JDK, JRE and JVM
		JDK- Java Development Kit
			Provides the tools, executables, and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java program
			Minimum for developing Java applications
		JRE- Java Runtime Environment
			Software distribution containing a stand-alone JVM and the Java standard library
			Minimum for running Java applications
		JVM- Java Virtual Machine
			Responsible for converting Java bytecode into executable machine code
	Java Build Process
		<-------------------------------------compilation---------------------------->
		MyClass.java __ javac MyClass.java__ Java compiler__outputs___MyClass.class____java MyClass__ Java Virtual Machine__outputs OS-specific 
		(source code)							(bytecode)						instructions

	Java Memory Architecture
		The JVM's memory architecture can be divided into two main data structures:
		Stack
			Used for static memory allocation of primitive values or references to objects in the heap
		Heap
			Used for dynamic memory allocation for Java objects and JRE classes at runtime
